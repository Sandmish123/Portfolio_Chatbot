# Sandeep Mishra's Portfolio with Chatbot Integration

Welcome to the interactive portfolio of **Sandeep Mishra**, a Software Engineer with expertise in Python, Machine Learning, and AI technologies. This portfolio features a chatbot integration that assists you with queries related to Sandeep's professional background, skills, and projects.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: A chatbot is integrated into the portfolio that can answer various questions such as:
  - Information about Sandeep's professional background
  - Skills and expertise
  - General queries about Sandeep's career and work

- **Floating Chat Button**: A floating chat button on the bottom right corner of the page allows you to engage with the chatbot anytime.

- **Predefined Responses**: The chatbot comes with a set of predefined responses to common queries, such as:
  - "Who are you?"
  - "What is your name?"
  - "Who is Sandeep?"
  - "What are his skills?"

- **Sensitive Information Handling**: The chatbot is designed to refrain from answering any personal or sensitive information-related questions.

- **Modern Design**: The portfolio has a sleek and modern design, with easy navigation to sections such as:
  - **Home**
  - **About**
  - **Resume**
  - **Projects**
  - **Contact**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, custom styles)
  - JavaScript for chatbot functionality
  - AOS (Animate On Scroll) for smooth animations

- **Backend**:
  - HuggingFace API for chatbot inference (DistilBERT model for Q&A)
  
- **Deployment**: The portfolio can be hosted using GitHub and any cloud services for backend integrations.

## How It Works

1. **Chatbot Window**: Clicking on the floating button opens the chatbot window. The chatbot is powered by an NLP model (DistilBERT) from HuggingFace API that processes your queries and responds accordingly.

2. **User Input**: Type in your query in the input field, and press "Enter" to submit. The chatbot will process the input and respond based on predefined answers or AI-generated insights.

3. **Predefined Responses**: Some common questions have predefined responses that are triggered based on the user's input, such as queries about Sandeep's background, skills, and other professional details.

4. **Sensitive Information Filtering**: If the user asks for personal information (e.g., age, address), the chatbot will politely decline to provide any sensitive data, focusing solely on professional details.
